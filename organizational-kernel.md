# The MOD Organizational Kernel

MOD Devices exists to __"Enable anyone to achieve any sound in any musical context"__. The MOD Organizational Kernel defines how the Organization is governed to pursue that purpose.

The MOD Organizational Kernel is derived from [Organic Organization - O2](http://targetteal.com/organic-organization) and [Holacracy](http://holacracy.org). See [License and Attributions](#license) for more details.

## <span id="adoption">Adoption</span>

By installing the MOD Organizational Kernel, Gianfranco Ceccolini, as the CEO and the Ratifier, cede his authority to govern and run the Organization or direct its Partners, and may no longer do so except through authority granted to them under the Kernel’s rules and processes. However, as an exception to this rule, the Ratifier may continue to hold and exercise any authority that they do not have the power to delegate, such as anything required by policies outside of their control, or by the Organization’s bylaws.

Any existing policies and systems the Organization has in effect before installing this Kernel continue in full force after adoption, even if they include constraints or authorities that are not reflected in the Organizational Structure. This may include compensation systems, hiring and firing processes, work-related policies, etc. However, these legacy policies and systems will lose all weight and authority as soon as Organizational Structure is defined that replaces or contradicts them. In addition, they may not be modified or added to in their legacy form. Anyone wishing to do so must first capture or otherwise empower the policy or system using the governance process defined in this Kernel.

The Ratifier or their successors may amend the Kernel or repeal it entirely, using authority given by the Shareholder Agreement. Amendments must be published at the [MOD Organizational Kernel Repository](http://github.com/moddevices/mod-organizational-kernel) and announced to all [Partners](#partners).

## <span id="organization">1. Organization</span></span>

The Organization is an entity created to express an [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose). It has assets that it controls and a clear boundary with the outside world.
This boundary is represented as the General [Circle](#circles) in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure).

### <span id="evolutionary-purpose">1.1 Evolutionary Purpose</span>

The [Organization](#organization) has an "Evolutionary Purpose", which corresponds to the *deepest creative potential it can sustainably express in the world*. The Evolutionary Purpose is the [Purpose](#roles) of the General [Circle](#circles).

### <span id="partners">1.2 Partners</span>

MOD Devices has "Partners", who are people that fill [Roles](#roles) and express the [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose).

### <span id="tensions">1.3 Tensions</span>

When pursuing the [Purpose](#roles) of one or more [Roles](#roles), [Partners](#partners) can identify a difference between the current reality and the potential they sense. These gaps, which may be issues or opportunities identified, are called "Creative Tensions", or simply "Tensions". Tensions move the [Organization](#organization) towards its [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose).

## <span id="organizational-structure">2. Organizational Structure</span>

[Partners](#partners) shall govern and define a layer of agreements that establishes expectations and limitations of authority between them. This layer, called "Organizational Structure", is organized in a hierarchy of [Circles](#circles) and consists of [Roles](#roles) and [Policies](#policies). Each [Circle](#circles) governs its own Organizational Structure, which can only be changed in the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting).

### <span id="roles">2.1 Roles</span>
[Partners](#partners) perform the work in one or more explicitly defined "Roles" in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure). A Role is defined by:

- A descriptive name;
- A "Purpose", which is a capacity, potential or unreachable goal that the Role will pursue or express;
- Zero or more "Accountabilities", which are ongoing activities other [Partners](#partners) can expect the Role will perform;
- Zero or more "Domains", which are assets the Role can exclusively control and regulate on behalf of the [Organization](#organization).

### <span id="circles">2.2 Circles</span>
A "Circle" is a [Role](#roles) that has the authority to break itself down in smaller [Roles](#roles), contained within itself. When a [Role](#roles) is transformed into a Circle, the [Partners](#partners) who filled it become the [Circle Lead](#circle-lead). [Circles](#circles) are defined exactly as [Roles](#roles), that is, through the elements name, [Purpose](#roles), [Accountabilities](#roles), and [Domains](#roles).

#### <span id="circles-cannot-modify-their-definition">2.2.1 Circles cannot modify their definition</span>
A [Circle](#circles) may govern its own [Roles](#roles) and [Policies](#policies), but it cannot modify its own definition, because that should be made in the outer [Circle](#circle) which contains it.

#### <span id="circulos-cannot-structure-their-inner-circles">2.2.2 Circles cannot structure their inner Circles</span>

A [Circle](#circles) cannot modify the [Roles](#roles), [Circles](#circles) and [Policies](#policies) of an inner [Circle](#circles) directly. However, a [Circle](#circles) can perform some operations in its [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode), like moving [Roles](#roles) from itself to one of its inner [Circles](#circles) and vice versa.

### <span id="circle-domains">2.3 Circle Domains</span>
When a [Circle](#circles) has [Domains](#roles) in its definition, only [Circle Members](#circle-members) may impact these [Domains](#roles) without violating the [Duty of preservation](#duty-of-preservation).

#### <span id="circles-can-delegate-domains">2.3.1 Circles can delegate Domains</span>
Through its [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode), a [Circle](#circles) may specify one of its [Domains](#roles) in a [Role](#roles) or inner [Circle](#circles). If that is the case, that [Domain](#roles) becomes exclusive to the [Role](#roles) or inner [Circle](#circles).

### <span id="circle-members">2.4 Circle Members</span>
[Partners](#partners) are considered "Members" of a given [Circle](#circles) when they meet at least one of the criteria below:

- Fill at least one [Role](#roles) defined in the [Circle](#circles);
- Fill at least one of the [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) in the [Circle](#circles);
- Fill the [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) [Role](#roles) or the [Circle Rep](#circle-rep) [Role](#roles) in at least one of the inner [Circles](#circles).

### <span id="policies">2.5 Policies</span>

"Policies" are either grants of authority that allow others to control or cause a material impact within a Domain, or limitations of authority. Policies are composed of a name and a description. Unless otherwise specified in their definition, the effect of a Restriction applies to all [Roles](#roles) and inner [Circles](#circles) from where it is defined. A Policy is part of a [Circle](#circles), as well as a [Role](#roles) or an inner [Circle](#circles).

#### <span id="policies-cannot-establish-expectations">2.5.1 Policies cannot establish expectations</span>

[Policies](#policies) cannot establish expectations, because that is the goal of an [Accountability](#roles). Nevertheless, a [Policy](#policies) can demmand action, but only for the [Partners](#partners) on which the [Policy](#policies) applies and in the specific condition that triggers it.

## <span id="rights-and-duties">3. Rights and Duties</span>
All [Partners](#partners) may enjoy the "Rights" presented below, but also are bound by their "Duties".

### <span id="right-to-refuse-requests">3.1 Right to refuse requests</span>
[Partners](#partners) may refuse requests, if there is no explicit corresponding [Accountability](#roles) in the description of the [Role](#roles) being requested. However, [Partners](#partners) must always accept requests that make sense to the [Purpose](#roles) of one of their [Roles](#roles), even if no explicit [Accountability](#roles) is recorded.

### <span id="right-to-act-for-the-purpose">3.2 Right to act for the Purpose</span>
When pursuing the [Purpose](#roles) of their [Roles](#roles), [Partners](#partners) are always authorized to take action, unless the [Duty of Preservation](#duty-of-preservation) restricts them.

### <span id="right-to-act-heroically">3.3 Right to act heroically</span>
[Partners](#partners) may temporarily ignore the [Organizational Kernel](#organizational-kernel) if this is useful and necessary for expressing the [Evolutionary Purpose](#evolutionary-purpose) of the [Organization](#organization). Initiatives or requests that have this quality are called "Heroic Acts". [Partners](#partners) must seek to repair any damage caused after a Heroic Act, by proposing changes to the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) or even to the [Kernel](#organizational-kernel) if necessary.

The authority to act heroically is limited to the authority given to the ratified Kernel. Contracts with third-parties, like the Privacy Policy, cannot be violated by an Heroic Act.

### <span id="right-to-leave-roles">3.4 Right to leave Roles</span>
[Partners](#partners) may at any time leave [Roles](#roles) they fill in one or more [Circles](#circles), unless they agreed otherwise with the [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) or any process that assigns [Partners](#partners) to [Roles](#roles).

### <span id="duty-of-expression">3.5 Duty of expression</span>
Each [Partner](#partners) is responsible for identifying one's [Tensions](#tensions) through each [Role](#roles) one fills. Each [Partner](#partners) is also responsible for trying to solve those [Tensions](#tensions), engaging other [Partners](#partners) in their [Duties](#rights-and-duties) or by proposing changes to the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure).

### <span id="duty-of-transparency">3.6 Duty of transparency</span>
When requested, it is expected that [Partners](#partners) share any relevant information about their [Role](#roles)'s work, including each project they are working on, actions identified, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics. When requested, it is also expected that [Partners](#partners) provide estimates and projections of possible conclusion dates of their work, even though those projections shall not be considered deadlines or committments.

### <span id="duty-of-prioritization">3.7 Duty of prioritization</span>

The prioritization of work within a [Circle](#circles) is an intrinsic domain of the [Circle Lead](#circle-lead). [Partners](#partners) must prioritize their work in alignment with the circle Strategy, or any other way defined by the Circle Lead.

### <span id="duty-of-attendance">3.8 Duty of attendance</span>

When requested, [Partners](#partners) must prioritize attending to the [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) even over working on their [Roles](#roles).

### <span id="duty-of-preservation">3.9 Duty of preservation</span>

[Partners](#partners) through the [Roles](#roles) they fill must not impact the [Domains](#roles) of other [Roles](#roles) contained in the same [Circle](#circles), without before obtaining an explicit permission from the [Partner](#partners) that fills the corresponding [Role](#roles). [Partners](#partners) also must note the [Policies](#policies) defined in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) and follow the conditions set out therein.

## <span id="circle-meetings">4. Circle Meetings</span>

[Circle Members](#circle-members) gather regularly in a space called "Circle Meeting" to perform one or more of the 5 special "Modes" described in the upcoming section: [Review](#review-mode), [Sync](#sync-mode), [Adapt](#adapt-mode), [Select](#select-mode), and [Flow](#flow-mode). Circle Meetings, to which the Duty of Attendance applies, are scheduled by the [Secretary](#secretary) and facilitated by the [Facilitator](#facilitator), two [Essential Roles](#essential-roles).

### <span id="only-members-can-process-tensions">4.1 Only Members can process Tensions</span>

[Partners](#partners) that are not [Circle Members](#circle-members) cannot process [Tensions](#tensions) in [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings), unless they are invited by a [Circle Member](#circle-members) to help in the processing of a specific [Tension](#tensions).

### <span id="meeting-format">4.2 Meeting Format</span>

Circle Meetings should start with a check-in round, where one at a time, each participant shares how one is coming to the meeting. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) then fills the meeting with one or more of the 5 [Modes](#circle-meetings), according to the meeting type, time available and the needs of the [Circle](#circles). The Facilitator must declare the name, goal, and clarify the rules of each Mode before starting it. Circle Meetings end with a closing round, where one at a time, each participant shares a final reflection about the meeting.

Sync, Review and Flow mode can be engaged by any number of members, not necessarily with the Facilitator and Secretary, as long as they do not generate outputs to any absent member. On Circle Meetings, scheduled by the Secretary with reasonable advance notice, anyone who fails to attend counts as having had no objections to any proposal, and can have project and action requests accepted by other members on their behalf.

#### <span id="tension-list">4.2.1 Tension List</span>

The different [Modes](#circle-meetings) are used to process specific [Tensions](#tensions) felt by the participants. Specially before [Sync](#sync-mode) and [Adapt](#adapt-mode), [Partners](#partners) build a "Tension List", with a small mnemonic title for each one. Tensions can also be captured by the secretary in the begining and during the meeting,

#### <span id="one-tension-at-a-time">4.2.2 One Tension at a time</span>

After the [Tension](#tensions) List is built, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must focus in one [Tension](#tension) at a time. This means the [Facilitator](#facilitator) should not allow other participants to try to include their perspectives in the [Tension](#tension) being processed, unless the participant who originally felt the [Tension](#tension) believes that perspective is useful.

### <span id="facilitation-policies">4.3 Facilitation Restrictions</span>

During the facilitation of each [Mode](#circle-meetings), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) can make choices about which patterns to use and how to facilitate each moment. However, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must always keep one's choices aligned with the goal of each [Mode](#circle-meetings) and the necessities of the [Circle](#circles). A [Circle](#circles) may also adopt one or more [Policies](#policies) that further limit how each [Mode](#cicle-meetings) is facilitated. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must respect those limitations.

### <span id="review-mode">4.4 Review Mode</span>

The "Review Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meetings) whose goal is to *give transparency about the work performed by the [Circle](#circles)*. It is up to the [Facilitator](#facilitator) to decide specifically how the Review Mode is facilitated, unless a [Policy](#policies) determines otherwise.

### <span id="sync-mode">4.5 Sync Mode</span>

The "Sync Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meetings) whose goal is to *quickly process [Tensions](#tensions) that do not require the [Circle](#circles) to update its [Organizational Structure]*. Typical outputs of the Sync Mode include actions, projects, help requests and information sharing. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must simply allow each participant who brought a [Tension](#tensions) to engage others in their [Roles](#roles) and [Duties](#rights-and-duties), until a path for solving the [Tension](#tensions) is identified. The [Secretary](#secretary) must record any requests accepted by other participants in their [Roles](#roles).

### <span id="adapt-mode">4.6 Adapt Mode</span>

The "Adapt Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting) whose goal is to *process [Tensions](#tensions) into changes to the [Circle](#circles) [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure)*. The only valid and allowed outputs in Adapt Mode are:

- Adding, removing or modifying [Roles](#roles) of the [Circle](#circles);
- Adding, removing or modifying inner [Circles](#circles);
- Adding, removing or modifying [Policies](#policies) of the [Circle](#circles);
- Moving its [Roles](#roles), [Policies](#policies) or inner [Circles](#circles) to an inner [Circle](#circles);
- Moving [Roles](#roles), [Policies](#policies) or inner [Circles](#circles) of an inner [Circle](#circles) to itself;
- Transforming one of its [Roles](#roles) in an inner [Circles](#circles), and vice versa.

#### <span id="proposal">4.6.1 Proposal</span>

During the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must facilitate a process that allows the participant who brought the [Tension](#tensions), the "Proponent", to craft a "Proposal" for solving it. This Proposal must contain only the operations described as valid outputs for the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode).

#### <span id="examples">4.6.2 Examples</span>

The [Proponent](#proposal) of change to the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) must be able to present examples of past or present situations where each part of the crafted [Proposal](#proposal) would solve or reduce the [Tension](#tensions). If the [Facilitator](#facilitator) considers the [Proponent](#proposal) was not able to present the required examples and clarifications, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must discard the [Proposal](#proposal). However, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.

#### <span id="objections">4.6.3 Objections</span>

The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must give each participant the opportunity to raise one or more "Objections" to the [Proposal](#proposal) presented. An Objection is a reason the [Proposal](#proposal) would cause harm and move the [Circle](#circles) backwards. The [Facilitator](#facilitator) may ask questions to help the "Objector" understand whether what one brought are "Valid Objections" or not.

#### <span id="valid-objections">4.6.4 Valid Objections</span>

An [Objection](#objections) to a [Proposal](#proposal) that seeks to change the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) is considered valid if the [Objector](#objecoes) believes that it meets all the 4 following criteria:

1. **Degradation**. An [Objection](#objections) is about a harm that the [Proposal](#proposal) may cause to the [Circle](#circles).
2. **Causality**. This harm is caused by the [Proposal](#proposal), that is, it does not exist without it.
3. **Data-based**. The [Objection](#objections) is based on current data or past experiences. In other words, it is not an anticipation of future events. However, if the alleged harm is so disastrous that the [Circle](#circles) wouldn not be able to adapt in the future, this criteria can be disconsidered.
4. **Role-related**. The [Objection](#objections) affects one of the [Objector](#objections) [Roles](#roles) in the [Circle](#circles).

When validating [Objection](#objections), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable. Valid [Objection](#objections) must be integrated.

#### <span id="integration">4.6.5 Integration </span>

If there are [Objection](#objections), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must facilitate a process for integrating them to the [Proposal](#proposal). The goal of "Integration" is to modify the [Proposal](#proposal) so it would still solve the original [Tension](#tensions), but without causing the raised [Objection](#objections). If the [Proposal](#proposal) is modified, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must give the participants another opportunity to raise [Objections](#objections). If a [Proposal](#proposal) is taking too much time to integrate, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) can discard the [Proposal](#proposal) entirely, in order to move to the next item on the [Tension List](#tension-list).

#### <span id="kernel-breach">4.6.6 Kernel Breach</span>

Any participant can raise an [Objection](#objections) of "Kernel Breach" if one considers the [Proposal](#proposal) violates the [Organizational Kernel](#organizational-kernel). The [Facilitator](#facilitator) must then ask the [Secretary](#secretary) to interpret whether this is true or not. This special [Objection](#objections) does not need to be validated with the criteria used normaly, but it should be integrated like other ones.

#### <span id="asynchronous-proposals">4.6.7 Asynchronous Proposals</span>

Changes to the [Circle](#circles) [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) can be proposed outside [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) and are automatically approved if all [Circle Members](#circle-members) declare they do not have any [Objections](#objections). If any [Objection](#objections) is raised or a participant declares one would like to treat the [Tension](#tensions) in a conventional way, the [Proposal](#proposal) must be escalated to the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode) of a [Circle Meeting](#circle-meetings).

### <span id="select-mode">4.7 Select Mode</span>

The "Select Mode" is a moment of the [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting) whose goal is to *choose [Circle Members](#circle-members) to fill one or more of the three [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles)*. THe [Facilitator](#facilitator) must facilitate the Select Mode through a democratic election process, where the majority of votes will determine the elected [Partner](#partners).

#### <span id="select-immediately">4.7.1 Select immediately</span>

Any [Circle Member](#circle-member) may ask the [Facilitator](#facilitator) to jump to the [Select Mode](#select-mode) and perform an election for one or more of the [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles). If that is the case, the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must do this immediately.

#### <span id="select-only-in-circle-meetings">4.7.2 Select only in Circle Meetings</span>

The election process of the 3 [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles) must be done only inside a [Circle Meeting](#circle-meeting).

#### <span id="eligible-partners">4.7.3 Eligible Partners</span>

All and only [Circle Members](#circle-members) are eligible for the 3 [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles), with the exception of the [Partner](#partners) that fills the [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) [Role](#roles), who is not eligible as [Facilitator](#facilitator) or [Circle Rep](#circle-rep) of the same [Circle](#circles).

#### <span id="tie-breaker">4.7.4 Tie Breaker</span>

In case of tie for the election of any [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles), the [Facilitator](#facilitator) must choose one of the following criteria to untie:

- The [Partner](#partners) that nominated oneself, if only one of the tied candidates has;
- The [Partner](#partners) that is already filling the [Role](#roles), if only one of the tied candidates is;
- Randomly choosing one of the tied candidates.

### <span id="flow-mode">4.8 Flow Mode</span>

The "Flow Mode" should be engaged when a member senses that the circle operation is constrained by relationship issues between members or influenced by any bias. This [Mode](#circle-meetings) must not be used to change the [Circle](#circles) [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure) or engage [Partners](#partners) in their [Roles](#roles) and [Duties](#rights-and-duties).

Once a tension for Flow Mode is raised, it's up to the Facilitator when and how it should be processed.

## <span id="essential-roles">5. Essential Roles</span>

Each [Circle](#circles) contains 4 "Essential Roles" automatically created: [Circle Lead](#circle-lead), [Circle Rep](#circle-rep), [Facilitator](#facilitator), and [Secretary](#secretary).

### <span id="elected-essential-roles">5.1 Elected Essential Roles</span>

When a [Circle](#circles) has two or more [Partners](#partners), it must elect in its [Select Mode](#select-mode) the 3 "Elected Essential Roles" of [Facilitator](#facilitator), [Secretary](#secretary), and [Circle Rep](#circle-rep). The only exception is the outermost [Circle](#circles) in the [Organizational Structure](#organizational-structure), which must not elect the [Circle Rep](#circle-rep).

### <span id="modifying-essential-roles">5.2 Modifying Essential Roles</span>

The [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) of each [Circle](#circles) can be modified during the [Adapt Mode](#adapt-mode). However, the following restrictions apply:

- The name and the [Purpose](#roles) of the [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) cannot be modified;
- New [Accountabilities](#roles) and [Domains](#roles) cannot be added to the [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) [Role](#roles);
- The initial [Accountabilities](#roles) and [Domains](#roles) of the [Elected Essential Roles](#elected-essential-roles) cannot be removed or modified;
- The [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) cannot be removed.

#### <span id="essential-role-modifications-do-not-propagate">5.2.1 Essential Role modifications do not propagate</span>

Modifying the [Essential Roles](#essential-roles) of a [Circle](#circles) applies only to the [Circle](#circles) where the modification took place. That is, it does not propagate to inner [Circles](#circles).

### <span id="outer-link-assignment">5.3 Circle Lead Assignment</span>

The [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) is chosen by the outer [Circle](#circles) by whatever process that assigns [Partners](#partners) to [Roles](#roles) in the outer [Circle](#circles). The [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) of the outermost [Circle](#circles) is assigned by the CEO of MOD Devices.

### <span id="assigning-partners-to-roles">5.4 Assigning Partners to Roles</span>

The [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) is accountable for assining [Partners](#partners) to the [Roles](#roles) of the [Circle](#circles) and may invite any [Partner](#partners) of the [Organization](#organization), unless a [Policy](#policies) says otherwises.

### <span id="facilitator">5.5 Facilitator</span>

The [Role](#role) of the "Facilitator" has the following initial definition:

**Purpose**: _Healthy [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings) aligned with the [Organizational Kernel](#organizational-kernel)_

**Accountabilities**:
- Facilitating the [Circle Meetings](#circle-meetings)

### <span id="secretary">5.6 Secretary</span>

- Establishing priorities for the [Circle](#circles)

**Domains**:
- [Role](#roles) assignment within the [Circle](#circles)

The [Circle Lead](#circle-lead) holds all [Circle](#circles) undelegated [Accountabilities](#roles) and [Domains](#roles).
