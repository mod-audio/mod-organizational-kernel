# The MOD Organizational Kernel

The [MOD Organizational Kernel](./organizational-kernel.md), or just Kernel, is a document that defines how MOD Devices is governed. It's derived from [Organic Organization - O2](http://targetteal.com/organic-organization) and [Holacracy](http://holacracy.org).

The Kernel is supported by a pattern library from O2. They're documented as the [Facilitator Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LTt49HROliIbzg9gYOKy_w4WvDOAkuITPsyTihfjNrE).

The Kernel is presented in one single file, very specific to MOD Devices, with the exact words signed by our CEO, when ratified. It doesn't make any sense to use it anywhere else then at MOD Devices without modifying it, and if modified, it must be renamed. It's designed to be that way: maintaining your own Kernel is part of the Organizational Kernel.
